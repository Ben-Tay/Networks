## Types of wireless networks

#### Wireless Personal Access Network (WPAN)
> Interconnects devices in a short span, generally, within a person’s reach.
* Generally used for `peripheral (related) devices` such as:
1. `Bluetooth`: radio communication that enables low-power, short distance wireless networking between phones, computers and other network devices.
2. `RFID or radio frequency identification:` Communicates using electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling to uniquely identify an object, animal, or person.
3. `NFC or near field communication:` a method of data transfer that allows short-range communication between `compatible` devices.
4. `IrDA or Infrared Data Association`: a set of infrared communication protocols that provide wireless, line-of-sight connectivity between devices.

#### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
> Wireless Local Area Network: Links two or more devices using a wireless distribution method,
providing a connection to the wider Internet through access points.
* Typically used for Mobile extension of wired networks:
1. `Wi-Fi`: radio signal sent from a wireless router to a nearby device
2. `Standards 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac`: older IEEE standards for WLANs that evolved to become
faster and more efficient. `802.11.ac` aka `Wifi-5` was introduced in 2013.
3. `Wi-Fi 6 (Standard 802.11 ax):` an IEEE standard for WLANs that provides faster throughput `(average time taken for data to travel)` speeds,
better battery life, and less bandwidth congestion `(lower transmission delay) `than Wi-Fi 5 technology. 

#### Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)
> Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks:
Connects several wireless LANs. Generally used to cover an entire city.
* Typically used for fixed wireless between the Internet and homes & businesses:
1. `Proprietary`: a vendor-specific wireless municipal network with proprietary standards and equipment.
2. `IEEE 802.16:` the standardized version of WIMAX with added features like OFDM and quality of service. It was developed in the mid-2000s.
3. `WIMAX`: a broadband wireless solution developed in the early-2000s as an alternative to wired DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) or cable, especially in rural areas. WIMAX stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access.

#### Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)
> Covers large areas such as neighboring towns and cities.
* Typically used for mobile access to the Internet from outdoor areas:
1. `LTE or Long-Term Evolution`: a converged 4G standard supported by both the GSM and CDMA network providers. In theory, LTE has a maximum downlink of 150 Mbps for `fast download`
2. `LoRaWAN or Long-Range Radio`: an open standard network that balances low power with long-range communication requirements.
3. `Cellular (4G/5G)`: a network based on a collection of “cell” areas, each with a cell tower at its center that connects to the internet via satellite. Cellular provides consistent speeds, reliability and efficiency.

## Wired vs Wireless

## Latest Networking Trends
1. WIFI-6 (IEE Standard 802.11 ax) offers better throughput, battery life and less bandwidth congestion
2. Network Analaytics
3. Network Automation - automate operations for faster recovery. There’s extraordinary strain on today’s NetOps teams with unprecedented volume in client counts, application traffic patterns, and new use cases(like e-learning, video conferencing, virtual events, and remote care).
Network automation is critical to ensure continued service and performance.
4. SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is a solution for today’s combined networking and security challenges. Adopted in cloud or hybrid models, and in on-premises data centers.
