## Client-Server networks
> Client-server networks are common in businesses.

Keeps files up-to-date and easy-to-find by ensuring users work on one shared file in `one location`.
* File-Transfer Protocol sites
* Webservers
* Websites

## P2P networks
> Peer-to-Peer networks are common in homes and on the Internet.
*  Examples include:
1. File sharing sites
2. Discussion forums
3. Media streaming
4. Voice over IP, or VoIP, services.

## Modems
> A modem, or modulator/demodulator, converts data into a format that is easy to transmit
across a network.

> Once that data reaches its destination, the receiving modem converts it back to its original
form.
* Eg: cable & DSL modems 

## Bridges 
> A bridge joins two separate computer networks so they can communicate with each other and
work as a single network.

> Can be wired or wireless

> Wireless Bridges:
* Wifi-To-Wifi
* Wifi-To-Ethernet
* Bluetooth-To-Wifi

## Gateways
> A gateway is hardware or software that `allows data to flow` from one network to another,

Example: a home network to the Internet.

> Gateways are distinct from routers or switches in that they `use multiple protocols` to connect
multiple networks.

## Repeaters
> A repeater, or extender, receives a signal and retransmits it.

> Repeaters are used to extend a wireless signal so it can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction like brick, steel, or concrete.

> Connects to `wireless routers`

## WAP (Wireless Access Point)
> Allows Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.

> The WAP usually connects to a wired router as a standalone device.

> The WAP can also act as a central wireless connection point for computers equipped with
wireless network adapters.
The WAP is plugged in to a wired network switch.

> The WAP reads each computer’s MAC address and forwards that to the wired switch, SUCH THAT `if the WAP is connected to the wired network with internet access`, your computer will also have internet connection

## Network Interface Cards (NICS)
> Connects individual devices to a network.
* Can be wired or wireless
* Today’s computers usually come with wireless NICs already built in.
* Most include ports for network cables so users can easily connect their computer to a network.
* Contains information about computer's MAC address

## Proxy Server
> A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a LAN and the Internet to minimize security
risks.
* The proxy server evaluates requests from clients and forwards them to the `appropriate server`
if those requests meet `preset security requirement`s.
* Hides an IP address so it cannot be tracked
* Saves bandwidth by storing files or information from a user for the `first time` and safekeeps them for future acess

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
> Monitors network traffic and reports malicious activity to the `network administrator`

## Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
> IPS inspects network traffic and removes, detains, or redirects malicious items `based on rules set by the network administrator`.
