## Older Internet Connection Types

#### Dial-Up
* Cost: Low
* Speed: Very Low
* Cannot talk on phone or be on internet simultaneously 

#### Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
* Low Cost & Speed
* Transmits data & phone conversations digitally over standard phone line 

#### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
* Medium Cost & Speed
* Cannot on phone and be on internet simultaneously

## Newer Internet Connection Types

#### Cable
* Medium Cost, High Speed
* Cable uses the same coaxial cables as cable television and is one of the most common connection types.

#### Fiber Optics
* High Cost, Very High Speed
* Fiber-optic relies on fiber optic cables to
`transfer data with light waves` instead of electricity.
* Fiber-optic is the fastest connection type.

#### Satellites (Wireless)
* Cost Varies, Medium Speed
* Relies on communication satellites that are `prevalent in rural and remote areas`
* GPS technology relies on satellites for positioning data.

#### Cellular (Wireless)
* Medium Cost, High Speed
* Cellular uses the same channels as
cellular phones and can connect anywhere.
* It is also known as `WISP`,
for wireless Internet service providers


## Wired Networking (WN)
> Wired networking refers to the use of
wire connections that allow users to communicate over a network
* Most computer networks still relies on cables and wires to `connect devices and transfer data`

#### WN: Dial-Up
* Dial up requires a modem and phone line to access the Internet.
* It was popular in the past, but has steadily been replaced by broadband Internet services.
* Pros: 
    * Widely available to every1 with a `computer, phone line and modem`, even to those in rural or remote areas, low cost and easy to set-up
* Cons:
    * Dial-up is very slow, is unsuitable for gaming or downloading media,
    * Cannot use the phone at the same time.

#### WN: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
* DSL connects to the Internet using a modem and
two copper wires within phone lines to receive and transmit data
* Pros: 
    * Faster than dial-up & Inexpensive
    * Dedicating channel (no sharing bandwidth), like circuit switching
    * Can provide wi-fi and uses existing phone lines

* Cons:
    * Slow speeds (less than 100Mbps)
    * Weak over long distances
    * Not always available

#### Cable
* Delivers Internet via coaxial television cable
* Best option for fast and reliable Internet if you
don't have access to fiber optic.
* Pros:
    * Lower cost than fibre as it uses existing tv infrastructure to reduce costs
    * Fast speeds
    * Better bandwidth than DSL
    * Strong over long distances (even far from ISP office)
* Cons: 
    * Bandwidth congestion (share w neighbours) during peak hours
    * Slow upload speeds compared to download speed
    * Susceptible to `electromagnetic interference`
    * Lower latency than DSL in most cases

#### Fiber Optics
* Fiber optic transmits data by sending pulses of light across strands of glass at speeds up to 200 gigabits per second. Optimal for `HD streaming or gaming`.
* Pros:
    * Efficiency & Reliable
    * Fast speeds & good over long distances, rarely lags
    * Good for streaming & hosting

* Cons:
    * Expensive & not yet readily available
